# Example of a Websocket Client using Spring's Websocket API + SocksJS + Stomp
This desktop application is a client for my [websocket server](https://github.com/jesjobom/websocket-server-spring-example) following the same functionalities as the JSP client inside the server project.
So this application is a simple chat like example of websocket, exploring some possibilities from Stomp like subscription on channels and private subscription.

More about this project on the server's README.
